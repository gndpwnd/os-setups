Get Started:

* Make sure that sublime text and cherrytree are installed on your system

      sudo git clone https://github.com/Labruhtoory/os_setups.git && cd os_setups/pwnnotes && chmod +x setup.sh && ./setup.sh

* In order to activate everything, just run 'room' preferably in an empty folder

* Keep in mind that this new command is an alias, so you may need to run 'source /home/username/.bash_aliases' if you get logged out or shut down.
